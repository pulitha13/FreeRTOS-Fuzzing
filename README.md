# FreeRTOS Fuzzing

This is a fork of the open source FreeRTOS code base that can be found here. This repository adds a demo that performs fuzzing on certain api functions to validate memory safety and detect potential undefined behavior.

To run, change directories into `FreeRTOS/Demo/Posix_GCC_fuzzing`, and follow the README located there.
